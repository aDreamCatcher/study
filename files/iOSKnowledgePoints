### UIScroll
* open var scrollsToTop: Bool // default is YES.

	// When the user taps the status bar, the scroll view beneath the touch which is closest to the status bar will be scrolled to top, but only if its `scrollsToTop` property is YES, its delegate does not return NO from `-scrollViewShouldScrollToTop:`, and it is not already at the top.
	
	// On iPhone, we execute this gesture only if there's one on-screen scroll view with `scrollsToTop` == YES. If more than one is found, none will be scrolled.
